# LoRaNode

A LoRa network, which demonstrates the architecture of a basic LoRa deployment including nodes, gateways, and the network server. An application server was put into use to collect readings from a remote weather station (deployed as a node). This data is then processed to make it viable for visualizations and insight collection. Apart from this, the data is also used to study RSSI and SNR values for LoRa.
